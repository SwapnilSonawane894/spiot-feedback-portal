# Security Improvements

This document outlines the security enhancements implemented in the SPIOT Feedback Portal.

## Authentication & Authorization

### 1. Rate Limiting
- **Implementation**: Added rate limiting to login attempts (5 attempts per 15 minutes per email)
- **Location**: `src/lib/security-utils.ts` and `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
- **Protection**: Prevents brute force attacks on user accounts

### 2. Secure Session Management
- **Session Duration**: Reduced from 30 days to 24 hours
- **Cookie Security**: 
  - HttpOnly: Prevents JavaScript access to cookies
  - Secure: Requires HTTPS connection
  - SameSite: 'lax' prevents CSRF attacks
- **Secret Management**: Moved from hardcoded secret to environment variable (NEXTAUTH_SECRET)

### 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Fixed**: Staff login redirect loop issue
- **Enhanced**: Middleware now properly validates both STAFF and FACULTY roles for /faculty routes
- **Protection**: Unauthorized users cannot access protected routes

## Input Validation & Sanitization

### 1. Enrollment Number Validation
- **Requirement**: Must be exactly 11 digits
- **Applied to**:
  - Single student creation endpoint
  - Bulk student upload endpoint
- **Protection**: Prevents invalid data entry and potential injection attacks

### 2. String Sanitization
- **Implementation**: All user inputs are sanitized to remove potentially dangerous characters
- **Functions**: `sanitizeString()`, `sanitizeEmail()`, `sanitizeEnrollmentNumber()`
- **Protection**: Prevents XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks

### 3. Password Validation
- **Requirements**:
  - Minimum 6 characters
  - Maximum 128 characters
- **Protection**: Prevents weak passwords and buffer overflow attacks

## Security Headers

The following security headers are now set on all responses:

1. **X-Frame-Options: DENY**
   - Prevents clickjacking attacks
   - Blocks the site from being embedded in iframes

2. **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff**
   - Prevents MIME-type sniffing
   - Forces browser to respect declared content types

3. **X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block**
   - Enables browser XSS filtering
   - Blocks page rendering if attack detected

4. **Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin**
   - Controls referrer information sent with requests
   - Enhances privacy

5. **Permissions-Policy**
   - Disables camera, microphone, and geolocation access
   - Reduces attack surface

## Database Security

### 1. Input Validation
- All database queries use sanitized inputs
- Protection against NoSQL injection attacks

### 2. Error Handling
- Generic error messages prevent information leakage
- Detailed errors logged server-side only

## API Security

### 1. Authentication Required
- All API endpoints verify user session
- Unauthorized requests return 401 status

### 2. Authorization Checks
- Role-based validation on all protected endpoints
- HOD and ADMIN roles required for sensitive operations

### 3. Request Validation
- All request bodies validated before processing
- Missing or invalid fields return 400 status with clear error messages

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables
2. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Secure cookie flag requires HTTPS
3. **Minimal Error Disclosure**: Generic error messages to users
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
5. **Least Privilege**: Users only have access to necessary resources

## Remaining Recommendations

1. **Consider implementing**:
   - Two-factor authentication (2FA)
   - Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
   - Password complexity requirements
   - Regular security audits
   - Automated vulnerability scanning

2. **Monitor**:
   - Failed login attempts
   - Unusual access patterns
   - API usage patterns

3. **Regular Updates**:
   - Keep all dependencies up to date
   - Review and update security policies
   - Conduct periodic security assessments
